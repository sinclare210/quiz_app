## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript


### What I learned

This project, was built using tailwind css,javascript.
I learnt about the insertAdjacentElement() method of the Element interface inserts a given element node at a given position relative to the element it is invoked upon. Also about the trim() that removes whitespaces from a textcontent.
When i havin hard time stopping to log event on click i google about it and found out about a tailwind class called pointer-events-none, that stop logging events to the console when clicked.
I also learnt about setInterval() function which is  used to execute a function repeatedly at a specified interval (delay).
lastly, i learnt about The clearInterval() function which is a crucial tool in JavaScript for managing time-based actions. By effectively stopping repeated actions initiated with setInterval().


### Continued development

I need to work on for loop more often.



### Useful resources
